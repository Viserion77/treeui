# @treeui/icons

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- a6561c0: **Breaking:** adopt a single `T`-prefixed public surface and drop the `Tree<Name>` compatibility layer.
  - The `Tree<Name>` component aliases and their global plugin registrations are removed; use `T<Name>` exports only (the `TNavbar` / `TAppBar` and `TSteps` / `TStepper` pairs remain).
  - Exported types are renamed: `TreeSize` → `TSize`, `TreeVariant` → `TVariant`, `TreeBadgeTone` → `TBadgeTone`, `TreeIconName` → `TIconName`, and so on.
  - Source SFCs are renamed `T<Name>.vue`, and component BEM classes are renamed `tree-*` → `t-*` (for example `tree-button` → `t-button`).
  - Design-token CSS variables keep the `--tree-*` prefix and the `[data-tree-theme]` attribute is unchanged, so theming is not affected.

  Migrate by replacing any `Tree<Name>` imports/usages with `T<Name>`, updating the renamed type names, and renaming `tree-*` class selectors to `t-*` in custom CSS.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e9b553: Add `TIcon` (alias `TreeIcon`) component: render any registered TreeUI icon by `name` with consistent sizing and a11y defaults. Icons are decorative (`aria-hidden`) by default, becoming `role="img"` with `aria-label` when a `label` prop is provided.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- c5fb383: Define the missing `--tree-z-popover` design token (`1050`, between
  `--tree-z-dropdown` and `--tree-z-sticky`).

  `.tree-navbar.is-sticky` already referenced `var(--tree-z-popover)` but the
  variable was never declared, so the rule resolved to `z-index: auto`. Combined
  with the navbar's `backdrop-filter` (which creates a stacking context),
  sibling page elements with any positive `z-index` could paint over a sticky
  `TNavbar` and any overlay rendered inside it (e.g. a `TSelect` dropdown panel
  in the `#end` slot).

  Declaring the token restores the intended layering without changing any
  component CSS.

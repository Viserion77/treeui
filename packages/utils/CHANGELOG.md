### Patch Changes

- c5fb383: Define the missing `--tree-z-popover` design token (`1050`, between
  `--tree-z-dropdown` and `--tree-z-sticky`).

  `.tree-navbar.is-sticky` already referenced `var(--tree-z-popover)` but the
  variable was never declared, so the rule resolved to `z-index: auto`. Combined
  with the navbar's `backdrop-filter` (which creates a stacking context),
  sibling page elements with any positive `z-index` could paint over a sticky
  `TNavbar` and any overlay rendered inside it (e.g. a `TSelect` dropdown panel
  in the `#end` slot).

  Declaring the token restores the intended layering without changing any
  component CSS.
